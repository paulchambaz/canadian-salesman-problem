def travelling_salesman_christofides(G: nx.Graph) -> tuple[Edge_Path, Weight]:
    """Approximates a solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem using Christofides' algorithm.

    This function implements Christofides' algorithm to compute a near-optimal solution 
    to the symmetric Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) on a given undirected, weighted graph 
    that satisfies the triangle inequality.

    Args:
        G: An undirected, weighted graph (nx.Graph) where edge weights represent distances 
           and satisfy the triangle inequality.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing:
            - A list of edges (Edge_Path) forming a Hamiltonian cycle that approximates the TSP solution.
            - The total weight (Weight) of the cycle.
